![Build](https://travis-ci.org/janneleppanen/weather-app.svg?branch=master)

Weather shows weather forecast powered by [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/). This is a side project, where I've collected things I've learned while developing with React ecosystem.

```
REACT_APP_OPEN_WEATHER_API_KEY=***
```

Run application `yarn start`
